# Angular CRUD Accounts Application Using Spring Boot

This is my submission for an individual project.

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8 and also [Sprint Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) version 2.0.2.

## Back-end Server

To launch back end, run 'mvnw spring-boot:run' in Windows or './mvnw sprint-boot:run' on UNIX OS's in folder 'server'. Some initial dummy data will be uploaded, all data can be viewed at `http://localhost:8080/accounts`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` within folder 'client' for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running end-to-end tests

TODO: make these tests. 

Run `ng e2e` within folder 'client' to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Running unit tests

TODO: make these tests. 

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Notes

I have had to force in a post map in order for this application to have post with the above method. The tutorial I followed did not require this somehow and if anyone has any idea why, I would be grateful to find out.
